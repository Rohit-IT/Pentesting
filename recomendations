AMSI Execution Bypass: Ensure AMSI is fully updated and enforce script block logging to detect and prevent bypass attempts.
Reverse Shell: Implement strict network segmentation and egress filtering to block unauthorized outbound connections.
Data Exfiltration via Malicious Scripts: Employ data loss prevention (DLP) tools and monitor outbound traffic for unusual patterns.
PowerShell Misconfigurations: Enforce PowerShell Constrained Language Mode and enable script block logging for enhanced security.
Execution of Malicious DLL: Use AppLocker or similar application whitelisting tools to prevent the execution of untrusted DLLs.
Deprecated TLS and SSL Protocols: Disable support for deprecated SSL/TLS protocols and enforce the use of TLS 1.2 or higher.
Host Header Injection: Validate and sanitize host header inputs on the server-side to prevent injection attacks.
SSL Certificate Signed Using Weak Hashing Algorithm: Replace certificates using weak hashing algorithms (e.g., SHA-1) with ones using stronger algorithms (e.g., SHA-256).
.ica File Modification: Restrict file system permissions to prevent unauthorized modification of .ica files and use digitally signed files where possible.
